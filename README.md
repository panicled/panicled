# panicled

Panicled is my homelab. It is used for experimenting with virtualisation, continuous integration, containers and infrastructure as code.

My goal is that the lab can be automatically rebuilt from source with feature flags to control configuration.

This repo will hold various build scripts and configuration data.

I have a [TODO list](documentation/TODO.md) which outlines the current work in progress.

Some background info on this concept: [blog](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/home-lab) and [blog](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/infrastructure-code) (not my blog).
